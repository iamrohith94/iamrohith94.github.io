Hello there. I guess you are here because you want to know more about me, right?

<h1 class="site-name">Exploring the world, place by place</h1>

I love travelling and exploring new places. Also, I enjoy adventurous sports. The pictures below are some of my favourite places and adventures of my life.

I am on a mission to explore the world. To keep track of this, I always make a note of the places I visited. To make this interesting I have plotted them on a map and this is how it looks.
