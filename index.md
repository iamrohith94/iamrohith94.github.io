I'm a MS by research student at the Lab for Spatial Informatics, IIIT Hyderabad. 

I'm an open source enthusiast. I worked as a open source developer for the Google Summer of Code 2016. I also worked as a mentor for the Google Summer of Code 2017.

I'm interested in GIS, open source, data science, databases, computer networks, graphs and path algorithm optimizations. I mostly code in C/C++, but also have experience with python, SQL programming, HTML, Javascript, PHP.
