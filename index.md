Hello, my name is Rohith Reddy Sankepally. I'm a software developer based in India. Being a tech enthusiast and a software developer, I am interested and curious to learn about ways that enable software to impact the world at a large scale. While I enjoy learning and new technologies, I continuously work on adapting them in the relevant tools/projects that I work on. In my free time I blog about the technologies and problems that fascinate me. Explore my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blogs">blogs</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects">projects</a> to get an idea of my work. I have compiled all my experience into a timeline which is shown below. Lets <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact">connect</a> if you're interested in discussing ideas and oppurtunities.
