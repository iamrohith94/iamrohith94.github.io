title: Graph contraction framework for pgRouting

Worked on this project for the Google Summer of Code 2016.

Overview
--------

Contraction is a technique used to speed up shortest-path computation by first creating contracted versions of the network. There are different ways of contracting a network. In this work, a framework that supports the addition of new contraction techniques was implemented. Two contraction algorithms: dead end contraction and linear contraction are implemented and integrated into this contraction framework.
