title: Implementation of a framework which supports addition of contraction techniques for pgRouting.

This worked on this project for the Google Summer of Code 2016.

Overview
--------

Contraction is a technique used to speed up shortest-path computation by first creating contracted versions of the network. There are different ways of contracting a network. I implemented a framework which supports the addition of new contraction techniques, and two contraction algorithms: dead end contraction and linear contraction. Installation of the framework together with the dead end contraction and also the implementation of linear contraction was completed during the GSoC.
